#### Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

#### Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
To create a repository on GitHub and clone it
  1. Click on the + icon in the top left of GitHub. Choose "New repository".
  2. This takes to to a page to create a new repository. Type in a name and put in an optional description. You can decide to add a README and/or license. Once ready, click "Create repository".
  3. You will get redirected to a page for this new repo. Here there will be an HTTPS url that you can copy. Copy it.
  4. Open terminal and redirect to the folder where you would like to clone this repo into using the "CD" command.
  5. Type in "git clone " and then paste the URL.

#### Describe what open source means.
Open source code or program means that the code/program is freely available to download and modify as you would like.

#### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I feel that open source has it's place, but shouldn't be used for everything. Developers can decide to choose to open source their project if they feel that the community can really help further the development. And open source communities can create some really cool things. But honestly, not everything should be open sourced. To some developers, they've spent a lot of work using novel ideas and sometimes there is an advantage to keep those ideas secret (especially if the developer wants to be compensated).

#### Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses are important because they describe what can be done with the project when it is being used. They are basically rules that people have to legally adhere to. There exist different types of licenses that producers can apply to their content that offer different rules. Using a license instead of offering your content to the public domain means that the original creator still keeps the copyright.

#### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
This extended from the 1.5 challenge, but I struggled with picturing a working branch from the master branch. I thought a file was deleted from my computer after I pushed it and merged it in GitHub, but I was simply in the wrong branch. Using a file browser GUI to monitor what was going on really helped me understand what was going on.

#### Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Reading the responses in Slack for my question from 1.5 helped. This response from Stack Overflow was also helpful http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7548926/git-and-the-branch-x-is-not-fully-merged-error .
