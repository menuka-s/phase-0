This challenge focuses on creating some functions that do some sort of calculation to an array of numbers. I don't know if we can assume that the array is already sorted from low to high.  I will try to descibe each function as a user case.

1. As the user, I want a function named "sum" that will return the sum of all elements in array. 

2. As the user, I want a function named "mean" that will return the average of all the elements in the array. 

3. As the user, I want a function named "median" that will return the median of all elements in the array. Hint: if there is an array that has an even number of elements, return the average of the two middle elements.
