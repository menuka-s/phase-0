<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was pretty rewarding seeing a webpage open up that I created. I haven’t had a lot of experience with HTML other than the CodeAcademy lessons, so getting actual practice by creating a website was pretty valuable.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
A lot of the terminology and usage we used came from our time with CodeAcademy. We did look into using entities such as the copyright logo, and it was neat to see how HTML has those built in.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
We tried to avoid any sort of styling with HTML. It is better to use CSS for styling. We did however prepare for styling by adding div’s. We will easily be able to move them each section when needed.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
A problem with HTML is that it is mainly just text. For our purposes we will need CSS to style it. A nice thing about HTML is that it is a lightweight, but powerful language. It is really efficient and easy to display what you want.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
We used this link: http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp which is helpful for adding entities for HTML. The div’s also will help us in the future to easily create and move sections (like the two columns in the actual page)
