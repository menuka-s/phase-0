## Reflections

### What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a visual mockup that can serve as the base for an overall website design. It is used to allow designers and developers a guide on how to structure and organize content when it is time to code. Wireframes can be created using simple drawings or programs. It is meant to be a basic mockup, not a full prototype.

### What are the benefits of wireframing?
Wireframing allows designers and developers to have an idea on how to structure a website and how content and media should be displayed. Since wireframes are simple, it is easy to update and change them quickly before it is time to code.

### Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
Yeah, I did. I'm a huge fan of human-concept interaction (HCI) concepts and techniques such as wireframing. It is such a simple way to get an idea of how your website can look.

### Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
Well my first idea before I started wireframing was to have a fancy website like [this one](http://www.apple.com/mac-pro/). Obviously I'm not talented like those web developers, yet :)
So I had to take a couple steps back, but I largely didn't revise my wireframe often. I wanted it to be simple, yet feasible to create.

### What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I have some background knowledge of HCI concepts from a class in college so I wasn't asking a lot of questions for this challenge. I did have to review some of the past challenges to remember how to display inline images correctly.

### Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I tried drawing out my wireframe on paper first, and then using a program to make a pretty version to submit. Drawing it out on paper was fun and simple, but using a program was a little annoying due to some technical difficulties.
